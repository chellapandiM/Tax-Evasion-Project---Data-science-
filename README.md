# 🧾 Tax Evasion Detection – Final Year Project

## 📌 Project Overview
**Tax Evasion Detection** is a machine learning-based system designed to identify individuals or organizations that deliberately evade paying taxes. By analyzing transaction records, tax filings, and third-party data, the system uses intelligent algorithms to detect anomalies and predict whether a transaction is legal or fraudulent.

## 🔄 System Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   Financial records, transactions, risk scores, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Cleaning, normalization, train-test split, feature selection.

3. **Model Training**  
   ML models are trained on labeled tax data.

4. **Prediction**  
   New data is classified as *legal* or *illegal*.

5. **Visualization**  
   Results are displayed using dashboards and graphs.
